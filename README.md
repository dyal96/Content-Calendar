## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

You can customize the categories and their associated colors by modifying the `<style>` block and the `categories` object in the JavaScript.

### CSS Variables for Colors

In the `<style>` section, you'll find CSS variables for category background colors:

```css
:root {
    /* ... other variables ... */
    --cat-youtube-bg: #ffcccc;
    --cat-facebook-bg: #cce5ff;
    --cat-linkedin-bg: #d4edda;
    --cat-instagram-bg: #fff3cd;
    --cat-blog-post-bg: #f8d7da;
}
```

You can change these hex codes to adjust the colors.

### JavaScript Categories Mapping

In the `<script>` section, the `categories` object maps the full category names to their shortened versions:

```javascript
const categories = {
    "YouTube": "YT",
    "Facebook": "FB",
    "LinkedIn": "LI",
    "Instagram": "IG",
    "BlogPost": "BP"
};
// Map shortened categories to CSS classes
const categoryCssClasses = {
    "YT": "category-YT",
    "FB": "category-FB",
    "LI": "category-LI",
    "IG": "category-IG",
    "BP": "category-BP"
};
```

To add a new category, add an entry to the `categories` object (e.g., `"New Category": "NC"`). Then, add a corresponding CSS class in the style block (e.g., `.category-NC { background-color: #yourcolor; }`) and update the `categoryCssClasses` object. Remember to also update the legend in the `<footer>` if you add new categories.
